# Beamable-Turn-Based-Multiplayer-Example-in-Unity

This project provides a simple and efficient solution for implementing turn-based multiplayer functionality using Beamable in Unity. While Beamable is primarily designed for real-time multiplayer, this example demonstrates how to leverage its notification service and a custom microservice to create a seamless turn-based multiplayer experience.

## Purpose

Beamable's pricing model is based on API calls rather than monthly Concurrent Active Users (CCU). Real-time multiplayer games quickly consume API calls during development and testing, leading to potential cost concerns. However, turn-based multiplayer, relying on notifications, significantly reduces API calls, allowing for extended playing time and accommodating a larger number of players within the monthly limit.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve and expand this example are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
